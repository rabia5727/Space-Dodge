# 🚀 Space Dodge

A beginner-friendly space dodging game built with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
In this game, you control a spaceship and try to dodge falling meteors as long as you can!


## 🎮 How to Play

- Move your spaceship **left** and **right** using the arrow keys.
- Avoid colliding with the falling meteors (stars).
- The longer you survive, the harder it gets!


## 🧠 Why I Made This

This is my **first ever game project** — created to learn game development basics and build something real and fun from scratch.  
The project is intentionally kept simple so that beginners like me (and you!) can understand, explore, and even improve it. 💡

## 🛠️ Requirements
